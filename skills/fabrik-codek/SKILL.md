# Fabrik-Codek

> A 7B model that knows you is worth more than a 400B that doesn't.

Fabrik-Codek is a **personal cognitive architecture** that runs locally with any Ollama model. It doesn't just retrieve documents — it builds a knowledge graph from how you work, measures your expertise per topic, routes tasks to the right model with the right retrieval strategy, observes whether its responses actually helped, and refines itself over time.

## How It Works

1. **You work** — Fabrik-Codek captures code changes, session transcripts, decisions, and learnings in a local datalake
2. **Knowledge extraction** — An 11-step pipeline extracts entities and relationships into a knowledge graph alongside a vector DB
3. **Personal profiling** — Analyzes your datalake to learn your domain, stack, patterns, and tooling preferences
4. **Competence scoring** — Measures how deep your knowledge is per topic (Expert / Competent / Novice / Unknown)
5. **Adaptive routing** — Classifies each query by task type and topic, selects the right model, adapts retrieval depth, and builds a 3-layer system prompt
6. **Outcome tracking** — Infers whether responses were useful from conversational patterns (zero friction, no manual feedback)
7. **Self-correction** — Adjusts retrieval parameters for underperforming task/topic combinations

Every interaction feeds back into the system. Fabrik-Codek itself makes zero outbound network requests — it only connects to Ollama and optionally Meilisearch on localhost. Model downloads are handled by Ollama's own CLI (`ollama pull`), not by Fabrik-Codek.

## Setup

Configure as an MCP server in your `openclaw.json` or `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fabrik-codek": {
      "command": "fabrik",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

For network access (SSE transport):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fabrik-codek": {
      "command": "fabrik",
      "args": ["mcp", "--transport", "sse", "--port", "8421"]
    }
  }
}
```

### First Run

After installing, initialize and build the knowledge base:

```bash
fabrik init                              # Set up config, download models
fabrik graph build --include-transcripts  # Build knowledge graph from sessions
fabrik rag index                         # Index datalake into vector DB
fabrik profile build                     # Build your personal profile
fabrik competence build                  # Build competence map
```

## Available MCP Tools

### fabrik_ask

Ask a question to the local LLM with optional context from the knowledge base. The Task Router automatically classifies your query, selects the right model based on your competence, adapts retrieval strategy, and builds a personalized system prompt.

- `use_rag=true` — vector search context
- `use_graph=true` — hybrid context (vector + graph + full-text)

Example: *"How should I handle database connection pooling?"*

### fabrik_search

Semantic vector search across your accumulated knowledge. Returns the most relevant documents, patterns, and examples by meaning — not just keywords.

Example: *"Find examples of retry logic with exponential backoff"*

### fabrik_graph_search

Traverse the knowledge graph to find entities (technologies, patterns, strategies) and their relationships. Useful for understanding how concepts connect in your experience.

- `depth` — how many hops to traverse (default: 2)

Example: *"What technologies are related to FastAPI in my knowledge graph?"*

### fabrik_fulltext_search

Full-text keyword search via Meilisearch. Use this for exact keyword or phrase matching when you know the specific terms. Optional — the system works without Meilisearch installed.

Example: *"Search for 'EXPLAIN ANALYZE' in my knowledge base"*

### fabrik_graph_stats

Knowledge graph statistics: entity count, edge count, connected components, type breakdown, and relation types.

### fabrik_status

System health check: Ollama availability, RAG engine, knowledge graph, full-text search, and datalake status.

## Available MCP Resources

| URI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `fabrik://status` | System component status |
| `fabrik://graph/stats` | Knowledge graph statistics |
| `fabrik://config` | Current configuration (sanitized) |

## When to Use Each Tool

| Scenario | Tool | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| Coding question needing context | `fabrik_ask` with `use_graph=true` | Gets hybrid retrieval + personalized prompt |
| Find similar patterns or examples | `fabrik_search` | Semantic similarity across all knowledge |
| Understand how concepts relate | `fabrik_graph_search` | Graph traversal shows entity relationships |
| Find exact terms or phrases | `fabrik_fulltext_search` | BM25 keyword matching |
| Check if knowledge base is healthy | `fabrik_status` | Component health check |
| Understand knowledge distribution | `fabrik_graph_stats` | Entity/edge counts and types |

## The Cognitive Loop

The system gets smarter the more you use it:

```
You work → Flywheel captures it → Pipeline extracts knowledge
    ↑                                        ↓
Strategy Optimizer ← Outcome Tracker ← LLM responds with context
    ↓                                        ↑
    └──── adjusts retrieval ──→ Task Router ─┘
                                    ↓
                  Profile + Competence + task-specific prompt
```

- **Personal Profile** learns your domain, stack, and preferences from your datalake
- **Competence Model** scores expertise per topic using 4 signals (entry count, graph density, recency, outcome rate)
- **Task Router** classifies queries into 7 task types, detects topic, selects model, adapts retrieval
- **Outcome Tracker** infers response quality from conversational patterns (topic change = accepted, reformulation = rejected)
- **Strategy Optimizer** adjusts retrieval parameters for weak spots
- **Graph Temporal Decay** fades stale knowledge, reinforces recent activity
- **Semantic Drift Detection** alerts when an entity's context shifts between graph builds

## Requirements

- [Fabrik-Codek](https://github.com/ikchain/Fabrik-Codek) installed from source (`git clone` + `pip install -e ".[dev]"`)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) running locally with any model (e.g., `ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b`)
- Optional: [Meilisearch](https://meilisearch.com/) for full-text search (system works without it)

**Note on installation**: Fabrik-Codek is an **instruction-only skill** — there is no automated installer. You install it manually from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ikchain/Fabrik-Codek) via `git clone` + `pip install -e ".[dev]"`. This lets you audit the full source code before installing. The skill itself contains documentation and MCP server configuration, not executable code.

## Security & Privacy

### No external network calls

Fabrik-Codek makes **zero outbound network requests**. It connects only to services running on your own machine:

- **Ollama** at `localhost:11434` — your locally running LLM server (for inference and embeddings)
- **Meilisearch** at `localhost:7700` (optional) — your locally running search engine

No telemetry, no analytics, no phone-home. Verify in the source: `grep -r "requests\.\|httpx\.\|urllib" src/` — all HTTP calls target `localhost` only. The only network activity that occurs during setup is `ollama pull`, which is Ollama's own CLI downloading models from [ollama.ai/library](https://ollama.ai/library) — Fabrik-Codek does not initiate or control these downloads.

### What `fabrik init` does

`fabrik init` performs these local-only operations:

1. Checks Python version (>= 3.11)
2. Detects if Ollama is running at `localhost:11434`
3. Creates a `.env` config file in the current directory
4. Creates local data directories (`./data/embeddings/`, `./data/graphdb/`, `./data/profile/`)
5. Pulls Ollama models via `ollama pull` — models are downloaded **by Ollama itself** from [ollama.ai/library](https://ollama.ai/library), not by Fabrik-Codek

Fabrik-Codek does not download any files from any server. Model downloads are handled entirely by Ollama's own CLI.

### Data access scope

**Reads** (all local, all opt-in, never automatic):

| Path | What | When | Why |
|------|------|------|-----|
| `~/.claude/projects/*/` | Session transcript JSONL files (already on disk from Claude Code) | **Only** when you explicitly run `fabrik learn process` or `fabrik graph build --include-transcripts` | Extracts entities and reasoning patterns to build the knowledge graph. This path is NOT in `configPaths` because Fabrik-Codek does not write to it — it is read-only and user-initiated. |
| `./data/` or `FABRIK_DATALAKE_PATH` | Your datalake (training pairs, captures, metadata) | During `graph build`, `rag index`, `profile build`, `competence build` | Source data for building the knowledge base and personal profile |

**Writes** (all local):

| Path | What |
|------|------|
| `./data/embeddings/` | LanceDB vector index |
| `./data/graphdb/` | NetworkX knowledge graph (JSON) |
| `./data/profile/` | Personal profile, competence map, strategy overrides (JSON) |
| `./data/01-raw/outcomes/` | Outcome tracking records (JSONL) |

All paths are declared in the skill metadata `configPaths`. The skill never writes outside these directories.

### Network transport

- **Default: `stdio`** — no network listener, no ports opened, no exposure
- **Optional: `sse`** — starts an HTTP server bound to **`127.0.0.1:8421`** by default (localhost only, not reachable from other machines)
- If you change the SSE bind address to `0.0.0.0`, your indexed data would be accessible over the network. **Do not do this** without proper firewall/ACL rules

### Session transcript privacy

The `fabrik learn` command reads Claude Code session transcripts, which may contain sensitive data (code, credentials, conversation history). This command is **opt-in** — you must run it manually. It does not run in the background or on a schedule unless you explicitly configure `fabrik learn watch`. Review what's in your `~/.claude/projects/` before indexing.
